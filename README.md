# Tutorials
NeuroTechX Tutorials &amp; Learning Material.

# TODO:

- Add content to software_overview.md
- Create Graphical representation for Devices + Software (A table perhaps)
- Extend to other types of devices, i.e. heart rate, eye tracking, stimulators (tDCS, tACS, tMS, tUS)
- COLLECT list of tutorials and other resources in it's own document.
- Make this into a Github Pages site so we can turn the markdown files into more accessible content for people using flatdoc or some other platform [like OpenBCI](https://github.com/openbci/docs)
